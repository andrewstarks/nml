##Building *nml*

At this point, building *nml* is accomplished with some very thin installation files that are likely to need your care and attention. My intent is to imporve these by rounding out the make files, creating more robust Visual Studio Solutions. Also, I will release them as LuaRocks and through LuaDist, as well.

For now, on the Mac and in Linux, you can run `make` and manually copy the files to where you need them.

In Windows, use the Visual Studio solution. You will need to manually locate the lua and *nanomsg* headers/library. Open an issue and I'll be happy to help.
